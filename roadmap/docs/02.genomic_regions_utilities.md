Utilities for analyzing genomic regions
=======================================



There are several functions in the **epik** package which provides convinient ways to
analyze genomic regions. This document demostrates the usage of these functions.

First we configure how to read data:


```r
source("~/project/development/epik/roadmap/data_config.R")
```

## Basic statistics

`basic_genomic_regions_stat()` simply makes barplots for some basic statistics for genomic regions.
There are following statistics:

- `proportion`: proportion in genome. If `by_chr = TRUE`, each bar represents the proportion in each chromosome.
- `number`: number of regions. If `by_chr = TRUE`, each bar represents the number of regions in each chromosome.
- `median_width`: meidan width of regions. If `by_chr = TRUE`, each bar represents the meidan width in each chromosome.

We use H3K4me1 peaks as an example:
